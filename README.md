Exploring the state, change and future of the space environment is critical for planet Earth, astronauts and spacecrafts. It is essential to
watch solar flares, solar winds moving rapidly towards the earth, and examine Earth magnetic fields that protect us from these harmful
solar activity. The ThemisB spacecraft, which examines the close earth orbit, and the Wind spacecraft, which studies solar activity,
were selected. In this study, data such as magnetic field and its components, solar wind speed, ion density and ion temperature were
obtained for two spacecraft from SSWEB-NASA and statistical analyzes were made. Data has been manipulated. Time series charts
were examined and correct future predictions were made using the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm. It was learned
from this research that information about future solar activities and the fate of changing magnetic regions can be obtained by using
historical data. It is obvious that this combination can take precautions against possible disasters.
